# Scriptmond Game Leaderboard

The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players of a game. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved thanks to [an external Leaderboard API service](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Leaderboard-API-service-24c0c3c116974ac49488d4eb0267ade3).

The project demonstrates, among other things, the ability of using a medium-fidelity wireframe to create a UI.

Here's the wireframe for the UI:
